To properly convert this project’s current build into a fully functional featured web application, 
we would first want to consider the client’s needs and then work outward from there. Our potential 
clients in this particular scenario are a combination of hungry customers and food truck owners. 
In this case the minimum viable product for us would be to focus keeping the application up and 
running as seamlessly as possible by limiting API requests and implementing unit testing. I noticed
that all food trucks in the database start and end their shifts at the top of the hour. Limiting 
requests based on that information and the introduction of a database/cache system would be a great 
initial sprint goal.

Once that is complete, we can start adding functionality to the product that will improve our 
client’s experience with the app. Adding manual filter and search options is a great next step if we 
can successfully limit out API calls before that point. I’ve already made some steps in that 
direction by utilizing the params.json file to predetermine the filters used in our API requests.

Once the client has access to these new features, we should focus on adding log-in options. Food 
truck owners can benefit from this by working us to verify their ownership and then be granted the 
ability to personalize their business with contact information, food menus, and special events. 
Customers can gain access to cached search and location history, and potentially even a review system 
down the road. If we start with a solid initial foundation, the possibilities are endless.
